  <div class="about-text">
    <h2>Our Roots: The Beginning of Shinra</h2>
    <p>
      Shinra Electric Power Company began as a humble weapons manufacturer, dedicated to providing the finest equipment to protect the people of Midgar. However, it was the visionary leadership of the Shinra family that transformed the company into a global powerhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its early years, Shinra recognized the untapped potential of mako energy, a revolutionary power source derived from the very life force of the planet. This discovery marked a turning point, propelling Shinra from a small enterprise to a leading energy provider. Through innovation and relentless ambition, Shinra began constructing mako reactors, harnessing this energy to fuel the growth of cities and industries worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Shinra stands as a symbol of progress and technological prowess. Our commitment to exploring new frontiers, coupled with our deep respect for the planetâ€™s resources, ensures that we remain at the forefront of global development. From our humble beginnings to our present-day status as a leader in energy and technology, Shinra's journey is a testament to the power of vision and determination.
