<div class="about-us">
  <h2>Our Roots: The Beginning of Shinra</h2>
  <img class="about-us-pic" src="images/old_photo.webp" alt="Shinra's early days">
  <div class="about-text">
    <p>
      Shinra Electric Power Company began as a humble weapons manufacturer, dedicated to providing the finest equipment to protect the people of Midgar. However, it was the visionary leadership of the Shinra family that transformed the company into a global powerhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its early years, Shinra recognized the untapped potential of mako energy, a revolutionary power source derived from the very life force of the planet. This discovery marked a turning point, propelling Shinra from a small enterprise to a leading energy provider. Through innovation and relentless ambition, Shinra began constructing mako reactors, harnessing this energy to fuel the growth of cities and industries worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Shinra stands as a symbol of progress and technological prowess. Our commitment to exploring new frontiers, coupled with our deep respect for the planet’s resources, ensures that we remain at the forefront of global development. From our humble beginnings to our present-day status as a leader in energy and technology, Shinra's journey is a testament to the power of vision and determination.
